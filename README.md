Successfully Completed My TDD/BDD Final Project! 🚀

I’m excited to share that I have completed a comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) & Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) project, applying industry best practices to build a fully tested RESTful API and web application. This project deepened my understanding of automated testing, API development, and UI testing using modern tools and frameworks.

🔹 Project Overview
✅ Developed a Product Management API using TDD principles.
✅ Created unit tests for the Product model to ensure data integrity.
✅ Built and tested RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations.
✅ Used BDD with Behave to write feature files and step definitions for UI testing.
✅ Automated tests for seven core functionalities, including Create, Read, Update, Delete, and advanced filtering.
✅ Achieved 95%+ test coverage using nosetests.
✅ Deployed and tested the application using honcho and behave.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
🔹 Python | Flask | Behave | Selenium | Nosetests
🔹 Git & GitHub for version control
🔹 Cloud IDE for development and testing

🎯 Key Takeaways
💡 Writing tests first helps catch bugs early and improves code quality.
💡 BDD ensures the application behaves as expected from an end-user perspective.
💡 Automating UI testing simplifies validation across different scenarios.
